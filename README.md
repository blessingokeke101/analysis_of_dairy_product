# Analysis_of_Dairy_Product
I assumed the role of a data analyst for a dairy association in India that looks out for the welfare, expansion, and advancement of the dairy industry in the region of study.
##  Problem Statement

The dairy association is keen on knowing how its member dairy processors(brands) are performing on the market and what kinds of dairy products consumers like. To get insights into product demand, market dynamics, and possible areas for product diversification, a thorough data analysis of dairy product sales and trends is required.

The dairy association also aims to curb financial losses among its member processors(brands) due to wastage by optimising inventory management for dairy products. Analysis of inventory levels, production cycles, and demand trends for different dairy products is essential to identify gaps.

The specific objectives are to determine;
1) most popular dairy product
2) consumers' preferred dairy products across different locations
3) consumers' most preferred brand for each dairy product
4) product that generates the highest revenue for each brand
5) highest sales year of each dairy product
6) quarterly evaluation of each dairy product
7) inventory turnover ratio of dairy products, and
8) dairy products' average shelf life


This analysis seeks to provide the dairy association with useful data so that its member processors may make informed choices, maintain their competitiveness in the dairy market, and receive useful recommendations for streamlining procurement.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this project was gotten from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suraj520/dairy-goods-sales-dataset?select=dairy_dataset.csv

## Recommendations

* Brands should focus their promotional efforts to capitalize on peak sales periods.
* Dairy farmers should diversify their operations to include plant-based dairy alternatives.
* The dairy association should implement a first-in-first-out(FIFO) system to ensure older stock is sold before newer stock to minimize the expiration of products.
* The dairy association should implement regular demand forecasting and monitoring of stock levels.
* Inventory levels should be adjusted to seasonal demand variations.
* Brands should align procurement with actual demand to prevent overstocking
